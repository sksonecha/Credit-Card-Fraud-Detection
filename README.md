# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Business Context:
It is important that the credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions 
so that the customers are not charged for items that that they did not purchase.

A fraudulent transaction is an unauthorized transaction that is carried out with a credit card. 
The thief either physically steals your credit card or steals your card information.
We are pushing on credit card skimming and using it to make payments or withdraw cash.
You might have heard about this in your family members or various other things in your neighborhood that a person has done a fraud transaction.

So this is a very big problem and this needs to be identified.
